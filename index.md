# Areas of Interest
In order of preference:

**Manufacturing**: Mostly discrete manufacturing, especially assembly processes. I am Familiar with aerospace assembly issues. One my areas of interest is enterprise connectivity for manufacturing analytics. Companies have different enterprise systems for inventory, personnel, quality and manufacturing exeution. Linking data to feed online simulation/optimization models to support decision making is alwayse needed. Process design, optimization and control of complex assebly netowrk with thousands of operations with different degrees of automation. Manufacturign issues such as ramping up production of new products, in process control of 

**Transportation & Supply Chain**: Network design problems including facility locations, capacity, and  inventories along a supply chain. Design of processes and interfaces among actors in the supply chain. Traffic capacity analysis for roads ad intersections. Intelligent Transportation Systems applications. Technology selection and evaluation. 

**Energy**: Activity-based energy consumption budgets, renewable energy configuration , high-level desgin of microgrids. Electric vehicles 



# Software
* **MBSE (SysML/UML)**: MagicDraw is my goto application. The regular uses such as create executable models,congurations/variants, behavior, ICDs , requirements.etc. On the extras I  have developed plug-ins in Java for MD , integrations with Matlab and Modelica. I am familiar with writing validation scripts using OCL. Developed domain specific extensions/profiles.  Currently into Functional Mockup Units and Co-Simulation.
* **Other MBSE**: I am familiar with Rhapsody , Doors Next Gen and Capella. Currently getting into open MBEE
* **Coding/Scripting**: Python, Java , C# (in that order of preference). I also fluent in VBA for Excel, MS Access and MS Visio
* **Software Engineering**: Familiar with development processes to generate and maintain optimization, simulation, quality systems and other anlytics tools for industrial applications via services. Familiar with continous delivery using. Use of version control software (Git) and containers in Docker. Familiar with several databases and I enjoy writing my own SQL queries.

* **Optimization**: My go to solver is Gurobi via API with Python for MIPs. I have used IBM CPLEX in the past and other solvers such as OpenSolver. In mathematical programming languages I am familiar with GAMS, AMPL and OPL.
* **Data Analysis**: Python , R , Matlab , Minitab
* **Simulation**: I am very familiar with Arena. Also developed some simulations in SimPy (Python) and Simio. In some cases I have developed my own simulators which have worked more reliably than general-purpose discrete event simulators.

* **Machine Learning**: Matlab for prototyping. Matlab NN tools been out for a number of years. Currently in Keras and Tensor Flow for RL. For metaheuristics , I usullay develop customized algorithms based on the knowledge of the problem (e.g. GRASP or any nature-inspired metaheuristic).

* **GIS**: ArcGIS, and python.

* **Traffic Simulation**: My go to program is PTV Vissim. I have created customized vehicle controllers for connected truck simulation via dll. Also manipulated the input files (XML structure) to create and run thousands of simulations.
